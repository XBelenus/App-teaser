# App-teaser
An app that was built to build more apps

this build is not complete in this pre-release but as a nodeJS user, it allow you to bootstrap you app in a seconde!

App&Teaser parts: "appmaker" and "backmaker" works hand-in-hand to generate PWA's

usage:

clone this git.

cd /appmaker && npm install

then "npm run dev" (i have had building issue, it will be fixed soon!! hopefully :) )

before you open your browser to navigate to http://localhost:3000/ open an other terminal and "cd" into the "backmaker" directory.

run: npm install

then run: node index.js

you can now open your browser and create !!

Have a lot of fun!

from Paris, love & passion ! Enjoy !!
